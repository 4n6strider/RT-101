## Just some words
So here I'm posting the sources of my RAT, this was for private use so do not complain if it's not compatible with ur crypters, with mine works. After that remember that this codes are for study only and to understand how this program works... this RAT as been based on socket server NJRAT so this is stable and before someone start crying: this is NOT Quasar or NanoCore copied, it looks like them because Windows control are universal ... 


## Concept
This Rat as been built in order to have a one BIG rat with functions like : Quasar, NanoCore and NJRAT. You can read the full description on [our website](http://www.sphinxsec.com/rt101.html "Rt-101 details page"), or watch the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq7TdknVWI0&feature=youtu.be)
